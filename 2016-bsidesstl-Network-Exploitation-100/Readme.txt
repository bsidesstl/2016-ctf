This is a Network Exploitation challenge worth 100 points
for BSidesSTL 2016.
The user is told to spoof an email from admin@SuperSecure.com,
to lopi@BSidesSTL.org.

In case you haven't noticed, this isn't really an SMTP server,
Just a python server pretending to be such a thing.  It somewhat
responds like a real SMTP server, though.  Kind of.

Flag: {STL-<C4nH4zSp00fz>}
