This is a Network Exploitation challenge worth 200 points
for BSidesSTL 2016.
The user is told that the network admin has locked down the FTP server
and has restricted user function to read only.  Can you find a way 
this might still be a problem?

In case you haven't noticed, this isn't really an FTP server,
Just a python server pretending to be such a thing.  It somewhat
responds like a real FTP server, though.  Kind of.
